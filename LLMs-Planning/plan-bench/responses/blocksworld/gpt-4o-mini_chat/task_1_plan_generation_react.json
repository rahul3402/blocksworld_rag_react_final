For example, if you want Block C on top of Block D, Block A on top of Block C, and Block B on top of Block A, ensure that this is clear.\n\n2. **Check Block Clearances**: Ensure that the blocks you want to stack are clear. If any block is not clear, you will need to unstack the blocks above it.\n\n3. **Execute Actions**:\n   - If Block D is not clear, unstack the block above it.\n   - If Block C is not clear, unstack the block above it.\n   - Continue this process until all blocks are in the desired configuration.\n\n4. **Final Stacking**: Once all blocks are clear and in the correct order, stack them according to your goal configuration.\n\n### Example Plan:\n1. **Unstack Block A from C** (if necessary).\n2. **Put Down Block A** (if necessary).\n3. **Unstack Block C from D** (if necessary).\n4. **Put Down Block C** (if necessary).\n5. **Pick Up Block D**.\n6. **Stack Block D on the table** (if necessary).\n7. **Pick Up Block C**.\n8. **Stack Block C on D**.\n9. **Pick Up Block A**.\n10. **Stack Block A on C**.\n11. **Pick Up Block B**.\n12. **Stack Block B on A**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy following these steps and ensuring that each block is clear before performing actions, you can achieve the desired configuration of blocks. Adjust the plan based on the specific goal configuration you have in mind.",

Let's summarize the actions taken and the reasoning behind them, and then outline a potential plan to achieve a goal configuration.\n\n### Summary of Actions Taken:\n\n1. **Unstack Block D from C**: \n   - Reasoning: Needed to make the block below (C) clear and accessible.\n   - Result: Holding D.\n\n2. **Put Down Block D**: \n   - Reasoning: Freeing the hand after unstacking.\n   - Result: D is now on C, hand is empty.\n\n3. **Unstack Block A from B**: \n   - Reasoning: Needed to make the block below (B) clear and accessible.\n   - Result: Holding A.\n\n4. **Stack Block A on D**: \n   - Reasoning: Achieving the goal configuration by stacking A on D.\n   - Result: A is now on D, hand is empty.\n\n5. **Pick Up Block C**: \n   - Reasoning: Necessary to stack it onto another block.\n   - Result: Holding C.\n\n6. **Stack Block C on A**: \n   - Reasoning: Achieving the goal configuration by stacking C on A.\n   - Result: C is now on A, hand is empty.\n\n7. **Pick Up Block B**: \n   - Reasoning: Necessary to stack it onto another block.\n   - Result: Holding B.\n\n8. **Stack Block B on C**: \n   - Reasoning: Achieving the goal configuration by stacking B on C.\n   - Result: B is now on C, hand is empty.\n\n### Next Steps to Achieve Goal Configuration:\n\nGiven the current state of the blocks, let's outline a plan to achieve a specific goal configuration. For example, if the goal is to have the blocks stacked in the order D on C, C on A, and B on A, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Unstack Block C from A**: \n   - Reasoning: To make A clear and accessible.\n   - Action: (unstack c a)\n\n2. **Put Down Block C**: \n   - Reasoning: Freeing the hand after unstacking.\n   - Action: (put-down c)\n\n3. **Unstack Block D from C**: \n   - Reasoning: To make C clear and accessible.\n   - Action: (unstack d c)\n\n4. **Put Down Block D**: \n   - Reasoning: Freeing the hand after unstacking.\n   - Action: (put-down d)\n\n5. **Unstack Block B from A**: \n   - Reasoning: To make A clear and accessible.\n   - Action: (unstack b a)\n\n6. **Put Down Block B**: \n   - Reasoning: Freeing the hand after unstacking.\n   - Action: (put-down b)\n\n7. **Pick Up Block C**: \n   - Reasoning: Necessary to stack it onto another block.\n   - Action: (pick-up c)\n\n8. **Stack Block C on A**: \n   - Reasoning: Achieving the goal configuration by stacking C on A.\n   - Action: (stack c a)\n\n9. **Pick Up Block D**: \n   - Reasoning: Necessary to stack it onto another block.\n   - Action: (pick-up d)\n\n10. **Stack Block D on C**: \n    - Reasoning: Achieving the goal configuration by stacking D on C.\n    - Action: (stack d c)\n\n11. **Pick Up Block B**: \n    - Reasoning: Necessary to stack it onto another block.\n    - Action: (pick-up b)\n\n12. **Stack Block B on A**: \n    - Reasoning: Achieving the goal configuration by stacking B on A.\n    - Action: (stack b a)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThis plan outlines a series of actions that adhere to the restrictions you've provided. Each action is justified based on the current state of the blocks and the goal configuration you wish to achieve. Adjust the plan as necessary based on your specific goal configuration.",

Assuming you want to stack all blocks in a specific order, here\u2019s a general plan based on the actions you've taken:\n\n1. **Ensure all blocks are clear**: \n   - If any blocks are stacked, unstack them to make sure all blocks are clear.\n\n2. **Pick up the bottom block**: \n   - Pick up the block that you want to be at the bottom of your stack.\n\n3. **Stack the next block**: \n   - Pick up the next block and stack it on top of the first block.\n\n4. **Repeat**: \n   - Continue this process until all blocks are stacked in the desired order.\n\n### Example Goal Configuration:\nIf your goal is to stack the blocks in the order of Blue (bottom), Red, Orange, Yellow (top), the steps would be:\n\n1. **Unstack Yellow from Orange** (if necessary).\n2. **Unstack Orange from Red** (if necessary).\n3. **Unstack Red from Blue** (if necessary).\n4. **Put down any blocks in hand** to free your hand.\n5. **Pick up Blue**.\n6. **Stack Red on Blue**.\n7. **Stack Orange on Red**.\n8. **Stack Yellow on Orange**.\n\n### Final Note:\nMake sure to follow the restrictions you have in place, ensuring that you only manipulate one block at a time and that each block is clear before you pick it up or stack it. If you have a specific goal configuration in mind, please provide that, and I can help refine the plan further!",

Here\u2019s a potential plan to stack all blocks into one single stack:\n\n1. **Pick Up Block d**: \n   - Reasoning: To stack it on top of the current stack (c on b on a).\n   \n2. **Stack Block d on Block c**: \n   - Reasoning: This will create a single stack with d on top.\n\n### Final Plan:\n1. **Action**: (pick-up d)\n   - **Observation**: {'(holding d)', '(clear a)', '(ontable b)', '(ontable c)', '(clear c)', '(ontable d)', '(clear b)', '(ontable a)'}\n\n2. **Action**: (stack d c)\n   - **Observation**: {'(clear a)', '(ontable b)', '(ontable c)', '(handempty)', '(on d c)', '(clear b)', '(ontable a)'}\n\nThis will result in a single stack of blocks with d on top, followed by c, b, a, and d will no longer be clear. \n\n### Cost:\nEach action has a unit cost of 1, so the total cost for this plan will be 2 (1 for picking up d and 1 for stacking d on c). \n\nFeel free to adjust the plan based on your specific goals or configurations!",

For example, let's say the goal is to have the blocks arranged in a specific order, such as:\n- Orange on the table\n- Yellow on top of Orange\n- Blue on top of Yellow\n- Red on top of Blue\n\n### Proposed Plan to Achieve Goal Configuration:\n\n1. **Unstack Red from Blue**:\n   - Action: (unstack red blue)\n   - Reasoning: This will make the blue block clear.\n\n2. **Put Down Red**:\n   - Action: (put-down red)\n   - Reasoning: This frees your hand for further actions.\n\n3. **Unstack Blue from Yellow**:\n   - Action: (unstack blue yellow)\n   - Reasoning: This will make the yellow block clear.\n\n4. **Put Down Blue**:\n   - Action: (put-down blue)\n   - Reasoning: This frees your hand for further actions.\n\n5. **Unstack Yellow from Orange**:\n   - Action: (unstack yellow orange)\n   - Reasoning: This will make the orange block clear.\n\n6. **Put Down Yellow**:\n   - Action: (put-down yellow)\n   - Reasoning: This frees your hand for further actions.\n\n7. **Stack Yellow on Orange**:\n   - Action: (stack yellow orange)\n   - Reasoning: This achieves part of the goal configuration.\n\n8. **Stack Blue on Yellow**:\n   - Action: (stack blue yellow)\n   - Reasoning: This achieves part of the goal configuration.\n\n9. **Stack Red on Blue**:\n   - Action: (stack red blue)\n   - Reasoning: This completes the goal configuration.\n\n### Final Observations:\n- After executing the above actions, you should have the blocks arranged in the desired order.\n- Ensure that at each step, the blocks you are manipulating are clear and that your hand is empty when required.\n\nThis plan should help you achieve the goal configuration while adhering to the restrictions you've outlined.

Always ensure that the blocks you are interacting with are clear and that your hand is empty when performing pick-up or unstack actions. If you have a specific goal configuration in mind, please provide that, and I can help you plan the exact steps needed to achieve it.",

Let's summarize the actions taken and the current state of the blocks after each step, along with the reasoning behind the next actions.\n\n### Current State:\n1. **Blocks and their positions:**\n   - Red block is on top of the white block.\n   - Blue block is on top of the orange block.\n   - Yellow block is on the table.\n   - White block is on the table.\n   - Orange block is on the table.\n   - The hand is empty.\n\n### Actions Taken:\n1. **Unstack (a, e)**: Unstacked block 'a' from block 'e'.\n   - **Observation**: Holding 'a', 'e' is now clear.\n   \n2. **Put down (a)**: Put down block 'a'.\n   - **Observation**: 'a' is now on top of 'e', hand is empty.\n\n3. **Unstack (e, b)**: Unstacked block 'e' from block 'b'.\n   - **Observation**: Holding 'e', 'b' is now clear.\n\n4. **Stack (e, a)**: Stacked block 'e' on block 'a'.\n   - **Observation**: 'e' is now on 'a', hand is empty.\n\n5. **Unstack (b, c)**: Unstacked block 'b' from block 'c'.\n   - **Observation**: Holding 'b', 'c' is now clear.\n\n6. **Stack (b, d)**: Stacked block 'b' on block 'd'.\n   - **Observation**: 'b' is now on 'd', hand is empty.\n\n### Next Steps:\nGiven the current state, the next logical actions would be:\n\n1. **Unstack (d, c)**: Unstack block 'd' from block 'c' to make 'c' clear.\n   - **Reasoning**: This will allow you to manipulate 'd' and 'c' further.\n\n2. **Put down (d)**: Put down block 'd' to free your hand.\n   - **Reasoning**: This will allow you to pick up or stack another block.\n\n3. **Pick up (c)**: Pick up block 'c' if it is clear.\n   - **Reasoning**: This will allow you to stack 'c' on another block.\n\n4. **Stack (c, e)**: Stack block 'c' on block 'e' if 'e' is clear.\n   - **Reasoning**: This will help achieve the desired configuration.\n\n### Summary:\nContinue following the reasoning and actions based on the current state of the blocks. Always ensure that the blocks you are manipulating are clear and that you are following the rules of stacking and unstacking.

Adjust the actions based on your specific goal configuration, and ensure that each action follows the rules of block manipulation.",
