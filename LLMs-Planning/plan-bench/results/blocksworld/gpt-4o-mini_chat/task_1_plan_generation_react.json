For example, if you want:\n- Block a on top of block b\n- Block b on top of block c\n- Block c on top of block d\n\n### Proposed Plan to Achieve Goal Configuration:\n1. **Unstack a from d**: This will make block d clear.\n2. **Put down a**: This will free your hand.\n3. **Unstack b from c**: This will make block c clear.\n4. **Put down b**: This will free your hand.\n5. **Unstack c from d**: This will make block d clear.\n6. **Stack c on b**: This will stack c on top of b.\n7. **Pick up a**: This will allow you to stack it.\n8. **Stack a on b**: This will complete the goal configuration.\n\n### Final Observations:\nAfter executing the proposed plan, you should check the arrangement of the blocks to ensure they match your desired goal configuration. If adjustments are needed, you can repeat the process of unstacking and stacking as necessary, always adhering to the rules you've outlined. \n\nIf you have a specific goal configuration in mind, please provide that, and I can help refine the plan further!",

Here are some potential actions you can take:\n\n1. **Pick up Block A**: \n   - This will allow you to stack it on another block or rearrange it as needed.\n   \n2. **Stack Block A on Block C**: \n   - If you pick up Block A, you can stack it on Block C to create a new configuration.\n\n3. **Pick up Block D**: \n   - If you want to rearrange the blocks further, you can pick up Block D (if it becomes clear).\n\n4. **Stack Block D on Block B**: \n   - If Block D is clear, you can stack it on Block B.\n\n### Example of Next Actions:\n1. **Action**: (pick-up a)\n   - **Observation**: {'(ontable b)', '(ontable c)', '(clear c)', '(ontable d)', '(holding a)', '(clear d)', '(on b d)'}\n   \n2. **Action**: (stack a c)\n   - **Observation**: {'(ontable b)', '(ontable c)', '(clear c)', '(handempty)', '(ontable d)', '(on a c)', '(clear d)', '(on b d)'}\n\n### Conclusion:\nContinue to follow the rules and restrictions as you manipulate the blocks. Each action should be carefully considered based on the current state of the blocks and the restrictions in place.

Blue block\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step plan to achieve that:\n\n1. **Unstack the Orange Block from the Red Block:**\n   - Action: (unstack c a)\n   - Observation: Holding orange block `c`.\n\n2. **Put Down the Orange Block:**\n   - Action: (put-down c)\n   - Observation: Orange block is now on the table and clear.\n\n3. **Unstack the Red Block from the Yellow Block:**\n   - Action: (unstack a d)\n   - Observation: Holding red block `a`.\n\n4. **Put Down the Red Block:**\n   - Action: (put-down a)\n   - Observation: Red block is now on the table and clear.\n\n5. **Unstack the Yellow Block from the Blue Block:**\n   - Action: (unstack d b)\n   - Observation: Holding yellow block `d`.\n\n6. **Put Down the Yellow Block:**\n   - Action: (put-down d)\n   - Observation: Yellow block is now on the table and clear.\n\n7. **Pick Up the Red Block:**\n   - Action: (pick-up a)\n   - Observation: Holding red block `a`.\n\n8. **Stack the Red Block on the Yellow Block:**\n   - Action: (stack a d)\n   - Observation: Red block is now on top of yellow block.\n\n9. **Pick Up the Orange Block:**\n   - Action: (pick-up c)\n   - Observation: Holding orange block `c`.\n\n10. **Stack the Orange Block on the Red Block:**\n    - Action: (stack c a)\n    - Observation: Orange block is now on top of red block.\n\n11. **Final Configuration:**\n    - Orange block on top of red block, red block on top of yellow block, yellow block on top of blue block.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis plan will achieve the desired configuration of blocks. Adjust the actions based on your specific goal configuration if it differs from the one outlined above.",

Let's summarize the actions taken and the reasoning behind them, and then outline a potential plan to achieve a goal configuration.\n\n### Summary of Actions and Reasoning:\n\n1. **Unstacking**: You unstacked blocks to make the blocks below clear and accessible. This is a necessary step to rearrange the blocks.\n2. **Putting Down**: After unstacking, you put down blocks to free your hand for further actions.\n3. **Stacking**: You stacked blocks to achieve the desired configuration.\n4. **Picking Up**: You picked up blocks when necessary to continue stacking.\n\n### Current State:\n- The red block is clear and on top of the blue block.\n- The blue block is on top of the yellow block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n- The orange block is on the table.\n- Your hand is empty.\n\n### Goal Configuration:\nTo create a plan, we need to define a goal configuration. For example, let's say the goal is to have the blocks stacked in the order: \n- Red on top of Blue\n- Blue on top of Yellow\n- Yellow on top of Orange\n\n### Proposed Plan:\n1. **Unstack the Red Block from Blue**: \n   - Action: (unstack red blue)\n   - Reasoning: To make the blue block clear.\n\n2. **Put Down the Red Block**: \n   - Action: (put-down red)\n   - Reasoning: Free the hand for further actions.\n\n3. **Unstack the Blue Block from Yellow**: \n   - Action: (unstack blue yellow)\n   - Reasoning: To make the yellow block clear.\n\n4. **Put Down the Blue Block**: \n   - Action: (put-down blue)\n   - Reasoning: Free the hand for further actions.\n\n5. **Unstack the Yellow Block from Orange**: \n   - Action: (unstack yellow orange)\n   - Reasoning: To make the orange block clear.\n\n6. **Put Down the Yellow Block**: \n   - Action: (put-down yellow)\n   - Reasoning: Free the hand for further actions.\n\n7. **Stack the Yellow Block on Orange**: \n   - Action: (stack yellow orange)\n   - Reasoning: Achieve the desired configuration.\n\n8. **Pick Up the Blue Block**: \n   - Action: (pick-up blue)\n   - Reasoning: Prepare to stack it.\n\n9. **Stack the Blue Block on Yellow**: \n   - Action: (stack blue yellow)\n   - Reasoning: Achieve the desired configuration.\n\n10. **Pick Up the Red Block**: \n    - Action: (pick-up red)\n    - Reasoning: Prepare to stack it.\n\n11. **Stack the Red Block on Blue**: \n    - Action: (stack red blue)\n    - Reasoning: Achieve the desired configuration.\n\n### Final State:\nAfter executing the above plan, the blocks should be arranged in the desired order: Red on top of Blue, Blue on top of Yellow, and Yellow on top of Orange.\n\n### Cost:\nEach action has a unit cost of 1, so the total cost for this plan would be the number of actions taken.\n\nThis plan should help you achieve the goal configuration while adhering to the restrictions you've outlined. If you have a different goal configuration in mind, please specify, and I can adjust the plan accordingly!",

Let's summarize the actions taken and the reasoning behind them, along with the current state of the blocks after each action.\n\n### Summary of Actions and Observations\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Orange block is clear.\n   - White block is clear.\n   - Hand is empty.\n   - Red block is on top of the blue block.\n   - Yellow block is on top of the red block.\n   - White block is on top of the yellow block.\n   - Blue block is on the table.\n   - Orange block is on the table.\n\n2. **Action 1: Unstack (unstack e d)**\n   - **Observation:** Holding block e, clear d.\n   \n3. **Action 2: Put down (put-down e)**\n   - **Observation:** Block e is now on top of d, hand is empty.\n\n4. **Action 3: Unstack (unstack d a)**\n   - **Observation:** Hand is empty, but d is not clear (still on a).\n\n5. **Action 4: Put down (put-down d)**\n   - **Observation:** No change, d is still on a.\n\n6. **Action 5: Unstack (unstack a b)**\n   - **Observation:** Hand is empty, but a is not clear (still on b).\n\n7. **Action 6: Stack (stack a e)**\n   - **Observation:** No change, still holding e.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the current state of the blocks, it seems you need to continue unstacking and stacking blocks to achieve your goal configuration. Here\u2019s a suggested plan based on the current observations:\n\n1. **Unstack the red block (d) from the blue block (b)**:\n   - **Action:** (unstack d b)\n   - **Reasoning:** This will make the blue block clear.\n\n2. **Put down the red block (d)**:\n   - **Action:** (put-down d)\n   - **Reasoning:** This frees your hand.\n\n3. **Unstack the yellow block (c) from the red block (d)**:\n   - **Action:** (unstack c d)\n   - **Reasoning:** This will make the red block clear.\n\n4. **Put down the yellow block (c)**:\n   - **Action:** (put-down c)\n   - **Reasoning:** This frees your hand.\n\n5. **Unstack the orange block (e) from the blue block (b)**:\n   - **Action:** (unstack e b)\n   - **Reasoning:** This will make the blue block clear.\n\n6. **Put down the orange block (e)**:\n   - **Action:** (put-down e)\n   - **Reasoning:** This frees your hand.\n\n7. **Continue stacking blocks as needed to achieve the goal configuration.**\n\n### Conclusion\nContinue following the rules and reasoning through each action. Make sure to always check the state of the blocks after each action to ensure you are following the restrictions correctly. If you encounter any blocks that are not clear or cannot be stacked, adjust your actions accordingly.",

If you have a specific goal configuration in mind, let me know, and I can help you plan the steps to achieve that configuration!",

Let's summarize the actions taken and the reasoning behind them, along with the current state of the blocks after each action.\n\n### Summary of Actions and Observations\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Red block is on top of the white block.\n   - Blue block is on top of the orange block.\n   - Yellow block is on the table.\n   - White block is on the table.\n   - Hand is empty.\n\n2. **Action Sequence:**\n   - **Unstack e from b:** \n     - Holding block e.\n   - **Put down e:** \n     - Hand is empty.\n   - **Unstack e from b:** \n     - (No change, as e is not on b)\n   - **Stack e on a:** \n     - (No change, as a is not clear)\n   - **Unstack b from c:** \n     - Holding block b.\n   - **Stack b on d:** \n     - (No change, as d is not clear)\n   - **Put down b:** \n     - Hand is empty.\n\n3. **Next Initial State:**\n   - Yellow block is on top of the red block.\n   - Red block is on top of the blue block.\n   - Blue block is on top of the orange block.\n   - White block is on the table.\n   - Hand is empty.\n\n4. **Action Sequence:**\n   - **Unstack d from a:** \n     - Holding block d.\n   - **Stack d on e:** \n     - (No change, as e is not clear)\n   - **Unstack a from b:** \n     - Holding block a.\n   - **Stack a on d:** \n     - (No change, as d is not clear)\n   - **Unstack b from c:** \n     - Holding block b.\n   - **Put down b:** \n     - Hand is empty.\n   - **Unstack a from d:** \n     - Holding block a.\n   - **Stack a on c:** \n     - (No change, as c is not clear)\n   - **Unstack d from e:** \n     - Holding block d.\n   - **Stack d on a:** \n     - (No change, as a is not clear)\n   - **Pick up e:** \n     - Holding block e.\n   - **Stack e on b:** \n     - (No change, as b is not clear)\n\n### Final Observations\n- The actions taken seem to be aimed at achieving a specific configuration of blocks, but there are several instances where the actions do not lead to a change in state due to the blocks not being clear or the stacking conditions not being met.\n- The cost of the actions taken is noted as 12 units, indicating the total effort expended in this sequence.\n\n### Recommendations\nTo successfully achieve your goal configuration:\n- Ensure that each block you intend to unstack or stack is clear before performing the action.\n- Keep track of which blocks are currently held and which are clear to avoid unnecessary actions.\n- Consider re-evaluating the order of actions to ensure that you are not attempting to stack or unstack blocks that are not in the correct state.\n\nIf you have a specific goal configuration in mind, please provide that, and I can help you devise a more effective plan to reach it!",
